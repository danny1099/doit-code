## [1.0.2] - 2025-05-10

### ‚ú® Added

- **Intelligent Task Validation System**: Automatic periodic validation to check if tasks still exist in code files
- **Similarity-Based Task Matching**: Smart algorithm to detect when tasks are modified vs when they're completely new
- **Configurable Validation Interval**: New `doitCode.validationInterval` setting to control validation frequency (default: 30 seconds)
- **Auto-Complete Behavior**: New `doitCode.autoComplete` setting to choose between marking tasks as completed or deleting them when removed from code
- **Similarity Threshold Configuration**: New `doitCode.similarityThreshold` setting to fine-tune task matching sensitivity (default: 0.5)
- **File Content Caching**: 5-second cache to reduce unnecessary file parsing and improve performance
- **Batch Processing**: Process files in batches of 10 to prevent UI blocking in large projects
- **Concurrent Validation Prevention**: Flag system to prevent multiple validations running simultaneously

### üöÄ Performance Improvements

- **Optimized File Scanning**: Parallel processing of file validations using `Promise.all()`
- **Smart Cache Invalidation**: Automatic cache cleanup when files are saved or deleted
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Better memory management for large workspaces
- **Non-blocking Operations**: Small pauses between batch processing to keep UI responsive

### üîß Enhanced Features

- **Better Multiple TODO Handling**: Improved logic for files containing multiple TODO comments
- **Intelligent Task Matching**: Best-match algorithm selects the most similar task when updating
- **File Change Detection**: Watches for file deletions and updates cache accordingly
- **Improved Task Grouping**: Tasks are now grouped by file for more efficient processing

### üìä Better Notifications

- **Detailed Change Messages**: Shows specific counts for new, updated, and completed/removed tasks
- **Action-Based Messages**: Different notifications for auto-complete vs delete actions
- **Reduced Notification Spam**: Only shows messages when actual changes occur

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where multiple TODOs in same file would incorrectly mark tasks as completed
- Fixed task duplication when modifying TODO text
- Fixed race condition in concurrent file scanning
- Fixed cache not being cleared on workspace rescan
- Improved handling of deleted files in validation process

### üîÑ Changed

- Validation now runs 5 seconds after startup instead of immediately
- Tasks are validated only if they have source files and aren't completed
- Updated task matching to prefer exact ID matches before similarity checks
- Improved error handling for file read failures

### üìù Documentation

- Updated README with comprehensive configuration guide
- Added examples for all new settings
- Included troubleshooting section for common issues
- Added task lifecycle documentation

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-20

- **Manual Task Management**: Create, edit, complete, and delete tasks manually
- **File Integration**: Direct navigation to TODO comments in source files
- **Smart Exclusions**: Automatically excludes common folders (node_modules, dist, etc.)
- **Multiple File Types**: Support for 20+ programming languages and file types
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks saved across VS Code sessions
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic rescanning when files change
- **Configurable Settings**: Customize exclusion patterns, file size limits, and supported file types
